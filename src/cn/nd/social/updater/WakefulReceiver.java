 * Forwards a command (an Intent packaged as an extra in the

 * 
 * This is necessary to support asynchronous user
 * confirmation, such as via a Notification. We need the
 * UpdateService to be able to continue to the next phase,
 * but the UpdateService needs to be a WakefulIntentService
 * to have a shot at completing its work. Hence, we cannot
 * simply have the Notification use a getService()
 * PendingIntent pointing at UpdateService -- instead, we
 * need to go through the standard WakefulIntentService
 * process, involving a BroadcastReceiver calling
 * sendWakefulWork().
